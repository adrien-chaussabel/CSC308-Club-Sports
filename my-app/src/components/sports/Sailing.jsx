      The Cal Poly Sailing team is a competitive Club Sport team at Cal Poly
      and stands as one of the schools oldest in existence. The team competes in
      regattas sanctioned by the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association of North America.
      The Sailing team competes in the Pacific Coast Collegiate Sailing Conference against
      schools from up and down the West Coast. The teams that they compete against in regular
      season regattas include Hawaii, Princeton, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and USC. Their
      competitive season, which is made up of 5 ranked regattas, takes place mostly during the
