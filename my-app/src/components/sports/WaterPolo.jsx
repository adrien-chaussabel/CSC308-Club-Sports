    <h2>
    The Cal Poly Water Polo Club is consistently
     ranked nationally every year. They are five-time National Champions 
     and look to continue with that tradition. Club members practice and perform at a
      competitive collegiate level. The team consistently has several players who are
       nationally recognized and awarded All-American honors. 
       The season begins at the start of September and ends in 
       the middle of November. Last season, the Men\'s Water Polo 
       team was awarded Team of the Decade honors by the Collegiate Water Polo Association.
