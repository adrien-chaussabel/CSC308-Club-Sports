    <h1>ABOUT SURF CLUB</h1>
    <h2>
    As good, big waves litter the coastline of Central California, 
    it is no surprise that Cal Poly is home to an excellent group of student surfers. 
    Comprised of both men and women who either short-board or long-board, the surf team competes
     against 20 other California universities over the course of five surf contests. Between November
      and March, the team travels about once a month to beaches like Black\'s Beach in San Diego,
       C Street in Ventura, and Trestle\'s in San Clemente to surf in contests. Surfers score 
       points for our team by impressing the judges and advancing through an array of playoff-style 
       brackets. The Surf team competes in the Southwest College Division of the National Scholastic 
       Surfing Association (NSSA) with schools like UCSB and San Diego State.
